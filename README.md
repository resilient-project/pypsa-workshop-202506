# Material for the PyPSA(-Eur) modelling workshop
*26-27 June 2025, DTU, Denmark*

This repository contains PyPSA(-Eur) materials for a workshop organized for a broad audience of researchers and industry stakeholders interested in energy system modelling.

The workshop is hosted by the **DTU Department of Wind and Energy Systems** — Marta Victoria, Aleksander Grochowicz, Lukas Karkossa, Parisa Rahdan — with support from the **DFF Sapere Aude project EXTREMES**. DTU team gratefully acknowledges funding by Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond (DFF) Sapere Aude—EXTREMES project (2067-00009B).

The workshop is co-hosted by the **ENSYS research group at TU Berlin** — Fabian Neumann and Iegor Riepin — with support from the **RESILIENT project**. TUB team gratefully acknowledges funding by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWE) under Grant No. 03EI4083A (RESILIENT project**) jointly with the CETPartnership (https://cetpartnership.eu/) through the Joint Call 2022, which supports our modelling workshops and public training events.
